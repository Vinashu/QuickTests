# QuickTests
Quick Testing Class for my Markers so they don't need to understand/use JUnit for bare bones testing

QuickTesting.java
=================
This is just a super generic easy testing class. All it checks for right now are BASIC equalities and boolean values. 
It also has some methods for collecting number of tests for pass/fail rates and the option to print more detailed output.
It's very very basic.

=========
This is specific to the Winter 2022 COMP 1020 class but since it's general I uploaded it for ease of distribution for my graders.
It also might help someone structure their own tests.

I honestly should probably make a TestObject instead with mesasges and things in it but I just did a brute force hardcode since this was literally just for me.
The actual MarkingPhaseX.java files are not uploaded in case a student stumbles in here but They just are all main.java classes that create necesssary objects and
run methods, etc. utilizing my QuickTesting class to run student assignments against a myriad of unit tests.
